# GUI-PDF-merge-App-Tkinter
Some fast Tkinter graphical user interface for PDF merge


Some fun little easy project of learning how to use Tkinter for first time. I had some experience with HTML5 and JavaScript so I got the idea of the Tkinter widgets reasonably quick.

Why a PDF merge App? Well if I was going to spend time doing this I might do something useful that I use a lot. The webpages for PDF merge I use are full of ads and unnecesary wait time so I used the PyPDF2 library (documentation: https://pythonhosted.org/PyPDF2/) and made my first simple App with the most 1990's look I could do.
